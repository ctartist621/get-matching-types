This is probably a dupe ( at least, `flow-typed install` actually does this by default )
however, this is a quick command line app that will make a list of all potential type definitions
that exist in NPM for your dependencies

Want to play around?

```sh
git clone https://github.com/orta/get-matching-types
cd get-matching-types
npm install

# This uses Typings for Fetch's type-definitions
npm install typings --global
typings install
```
